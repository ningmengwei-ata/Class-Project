    "\n",
    "### Why?\n",
    "\n",

    "* We want you to be ready to use one of these frameworks for your project so you can experiment more efficiently than if you were writing every feature you want to use by hand. \n",
    "* We want you to stand on the shoulders of giants! TensorFlow and PyTorch are both excellent frameworks that will make your lives a lot easier, and now that you understand their guts, you are free to use them :) \n",

    "\n",
    "### PyTorch versions\n",
    "This notebook assumes that you are using **PyTorch version 1.0**. In some of the previous versions (e.g. before 0.4), Tensors had to be wrapped in Variable objects to be used in autograd; however Variables have now been deprecated. In addition 1.0 also separates a Tensor's datatype from its device, and uses numpy-style factories for constructing Tensors rather than directly invoking Tensor constructors."

    "# Part III. PyTorch Module API\n",
    "\n",
    "Barebone PyTorch要求我们手动跟踪所有参数的tensors。这对于具有几个tensors的小型网络倒是没什么问题，但是在较大的网络中跟踪数十个或数百个tensors将非常不方便且容易出错。\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch为您提供`nn.Module` API，以定义任意网络架构，同时为您跟踪每个可学习的参数。在Part II中，我们自己实现了SGD。PyTorch还提供了`torch.optim`软件包，该软件包实现了所有常见的优化器，例如RMSProp，Adagrad和Adam。它甚至支持近似二阶方法，例如L-BFGS！您可以参考[doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) 了解每个优化器的详细信息。\n",
    "\n",
    "要使用Module API，请按照以下步骤操作：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 定义`nn.Module`的子类，并给您的类起一个直观的名称，例如`TwoLayerFC`。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 在构造函数`__init__()`中，将所有的层定义为类属性。像 `nn.Linear`和`nn.Conv2d`这样的层对象本身就是`nn.Module` 子类，并且包含可学习的参数，因此您不必自己实例化原始tensors。`nn.Module`将为您追踪这些内部参数。请参阅[doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html)，以了解有关内置层的更多信息。**警告**：别忘了先调用`super（）.__ init __（）`！\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 在`forward()`方法中，定义网络的*connectivity*。你应该使用 `__init__`中定义的属性作为函数调用，把tensor作为输入，把“变换后的”tensor作为输出。。*不要*在`forward（）`中创建任何带有可学习参数的新层！所有这些都必须在`__init__`中预先声明。\n",
    "\n",
    "定义Module子类后，可以将其实例化为对象，然后像part II中的NN forward函数一样调用它。\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module API: Two-Layer Network\n",
    "这是两层全连接网络的具体示例："
